/**
   * @brief Compute renorm(sigmoid) and topk for moe input.
   *
   * @par Inputs:
   * @li x: A 2D tensor which moe gating topk is applied, The shape is: (B*S, E), format supports ND, and data type must be float16, float or bfloat16. E(Expert num) can not be greater than 2048. E(Expert num) should be divisible by group_count.
   * @li bias: A 1D tensor which is "bias" in moe gating topk. The shape is: (E), format supports ND, and data type must be the same as that of x.
   *
   * @par Outputs:
   * @li y: A 2D tensor which is the topk value result of moe gating topk, format supports ND, and data type must be the same as that of x.
         The size of the non-1 axis must be the same as that of the corresponding axis of x.
         The size of the -1 axis must be the same as that of k.
   * @li expert_idx: A 2D tensor which is the topk index result of moe gating topk, format supports ND, and data type must be int. The shape must be the same as that of y.
   * @li out: A 2D tensor which is the renorm result of moe gating topk, format supports ND, and data type must be float. The shape must be the same as that of x.
   *
   * @par Attributes:
   * @li k: A required attribute of type int. The value must greater than 0 and less than or equal to expert_num / group_count * k_group, idicating the topk value.
   * @li k_group: An optional attribute of type int. It can not be less than 1, and can not be greater than group_count, indicating the topk group value. The default value is 1.
   * @li group_count: An optional attribute of type int. It can not be less than 1, indicating the group count. The group_count * align_32(expert_num / group_count) can not be greater than 2048. The default value is 1.
   * @li group_select_mode: An optional attribute of type int. 0 indicating that sort group by max values, 1 indicating that sort group by sum of top-2 values. The default value is 0.
   * @li renorm: An optional attribute of type int. It can only be 0 now, indicating that norm firstly and then topk. The default value is 0.
   * @li norm_type: An optional attribute of type int. 0 indicating that the softmax function is used, 1 indicating that the sigmoid function is used. The default value is 0.
   * @li out_flag: An optional attribute of type bool. true indicating that has renorm output, false indicating that does not have renorm output. The default value is false.
   * @li routed_scaling_factor: An optional attribute of type float, indicating the routed_scaling_factor coefficient in use. The default value is 1.0.
   * @li eps: An optional attribute of type float, indicating the eps coefficient in use. The default value is 1e-20.
   *
   * @par Restrictions:
   * Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS EXPERIMENTAL. Please do not use.
   *
   * - Ascend 910_95 AI Processor:
   * The attribute group_select_mode can only be 1 now.
   * The attribute norm_type can only be 1 now.
   * The attribute out_flag can only be false now.
