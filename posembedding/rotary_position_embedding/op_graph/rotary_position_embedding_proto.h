/**
 * @brief Apply rotary position embedding for a single tensor.
 * @par Inputs:
 * @li x: A 4D tensor which rotary position embedding is applied, format supports ND, and data type must be float16,
 * float or bfloat16.
 * @li cos: A 4D tensor which is "cos" in rotary position embedding, format supports ND, data type must be the same as
 * "x", and shape must be the same as "sin".
 * @li sin: A 4D tensor which is "sin" in rotary position embedding, format supports ND, data type must be the same as
 * "x", and shape must be the same as "cos".
 * @par Outputs:
 * y: A 4D tensor which is the result of rotary position embedding, format supports ND, data type must be the same as
 * "x", and shape must be the same as "x".
 * @par Attributes:
 * mode: An optional attribute of type int, specifying the mode of rotary position embedding, must be 0-"half",
 * 1-"interleave", 2-"quarter" or 3-"interleave-half". Defaults to 0. Atlas A2 Training Series Product/ Atlas 800I A2
 * Inference Product and Atlas A3 Training Series Product only support 0-"half" and 1-"interleave".
 * @attention Constraints:
 * Let (B, S, N, D) represents the shape of the 4-D input "x". Under this representation, the shape constraints of each
 * parameter can be described as follows:
 * @li The D of "x", "cos", "sin" and "y" must be equal. For Ascend 910_95 AI Processor, D should be less or equal to
 * 1024. For Atlas A2 Training Series Product/ Atlas 800I A2 Inference Product and Atlas A3 Training Series Product, D
 * should be less or equal to 896.
 * @li In half, interleave and interleave-half mode, D must be a multiple of 2. In quarter mode, D must be a multiple
 * of 4.
 * @li B, S, N of "cos" and "sin" must meet one of the following four conditions:
 *  - B, S, N are 1, means the shape is (1, 1, 1, D).
 *  - B, S, N are the same as that of "x", means the shape is (B, S, N, D).
 *  - One of S and N is 1, the remaining one dimension and B are the same as that of "x", means the shape is (B, 1, N,
 * D) or (B, S, 1, D).
 *  - Two of B, S and N are 1, the remaining one dimension is the same as that of "x", means the shape is (1, 1, N, D),
 * (1, S, 1, D) or (B, 1, 1, D).
